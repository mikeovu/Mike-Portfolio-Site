## Professional History


I have been an IT professional, specializing in network administration and design for a decade. Here's an abridged story of how I went from a political science major in college to where I am now:

:school: 2005 - 2009: Majored in Political Science at UCLA and worked as an AV Technician for the student Union.

:musical_note: 2006 - 2010: Toured around the country as a drummer in a band, where I obtained certain skills that would come in handy later in life. Some of the skills included building a social network in the music industry, face to face sales at malls (soliciting our album), and audio visual engineering (live sound and recording). 

:computer: 2011 - 2013: Learned the true value of a degree in political science :poop: This meant that I had to leverage my experience as a former college AV tech, as well as the skills I gained as a touring musician to obtain a job in corporate AV support. During my time as a corpoate AV support tech, I learned how to become an IT systems administrator, configuring and troubleshooting media servers, network switches, and end user machines. I eventually landed a job as a contractor at Google, which was a big milestone for me as an IT professional.

:signal_strength: 2014 - Present: I got a job at Coursea, where I was able to dive into network administration. This is where I decided to stick with network engineering as a long-term career path. I became a CCNA, worked in network operations for a few more years at a couple more companies - Cisco Meraki, Roche, and Stitch Fix. This experience lead to my current position as a pre-sales Solutions Engineer at Cisco Meraki
